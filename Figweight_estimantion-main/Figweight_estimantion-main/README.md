# Pig measuring animal volume and weight based on image data collection, processing, and detection
AI project topic
Development of AI for measuring animal volume and weight based on images.
Description: Collection and processing of volume data for pig. Calculation of the volume of the subject captured by a camera without the need for scale.
Input: Pig images
Output: Pig detection and Weight of pigs. 

# Abstract 
In commercial pig production, measuring body weight is one of the most important keys to monitor animal conditions including growth performance and health status. The pig's body weight can be used to determine the nutrient requirements, the drug dosages, and the time to market. However, to drive the pigs to weighing equipment is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This activity also induces pigs to become stressed or injured. Instead, body measurements such as heart girth and length have been applied to estimate live body weight. The studies showed a high positive correlation between body measurement and pig body weight. Based on that, we propose a system that uses deep learning to learn from images and estimate weight through heart length and circumference.
